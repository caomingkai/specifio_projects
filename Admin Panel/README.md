#### 1. Introduction: 
1. With Specifio’s Doc Plans feature, practitioners can control how Specifio creates draft applications so they consistently meet the preferences and requirements of clients and reviewers.

2. A practitioner’s “active” Doc Plan controls the appearance, content, and structure of the auto-drafts created by Specifio.

3. Practitioners can design a collection of different Doc Plans for different clients, technologies, or reviewers.

4. Doc Plans can be shared among registered users within your firm.
